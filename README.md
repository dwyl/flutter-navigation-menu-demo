# Why? 🤷‍

This small demo is meant for *anyone*
who wants to see a quick implementation
of [**progressive UX/UI**](https://github.com/dwyl/product-roadmap/issues/43).

# What? 💭

We want to add an easy onboarding experience
for users when they start using our 
[`app`](https://github.com/dwyl/app).

As we are using `Flutter` to develop our app,
this demo will focus on a `Dart` implementation of this,
focussing on the navigation menu component.


# Who? 👤

This quick demo is aimed at people in the @dwyl team
who need to understand how to create 
a basic app navigation that is *progressive*.

# _How_? 👩‍💻

## Prerequisites? 📝

This `demo` assumes you have foundational knowledge
of `Flutter`.

If this is your first time using `Flutter`,
we highly suggest you check out
[`dwyl/learn-flutter`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-flutter)
for a *primer* on how to get up-and-running with `Flutter`.
